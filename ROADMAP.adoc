== Overview

This roadmap outlines the development plan for Bunsenite, the Nickel configuration file parser with multi-language FFI bindings.

== v1.0 - Production Release (Current)

**Target:** 2026-02
**Status:** Active development (85% complete)

=== Core Features
* ✅ Rust core library with Nickel parsing
* ✅ Zero `unsafe` blocks (100% safe Rust)
* ✅ C ABI layer via Zig for FFI
* ✅ Deno bindings (JavaScript/TypeScript)
* ✅ ReScript bindings
* ✅ WebAssembly support (browser + universal)
* ✅ Offline-first architecture (no network dependencies)

=== Quality & Standards
* ✅ RSR Bronze tier compliance
* ✅ TPCF Perimeter 3 compliance
* ✅ 100% test pass rate
* ✅ CI/CD pipeline
* ✅ Comprehensive documentation
* ✅ ClusterFuzzLite fuzzing
* ✅ Criterion benchmarks

=== Remaining for v1.0
* [ ] Complete ROADMAP.adoc (this file)
* [ ] Address placeholder TODOs in codebase
* [ ] Final security audit
* [ ] Performance optimization pass
* [ ] Release automation
